<p>Beyond supporting seniors to age actively, we also understand that there
are seniors who are concerned about being adequately cared for in their
homes and in their community.</p>
<p>To strengthen support for frailer seniors and provide greater reassurance
to family members, we are developing more options for seniors to receive
timely and appropriate care right where they are.</p>
<h4>Enhanced Home Personal Care (HPC+)&nbsp;</h4>

<p>We are enhancing the home personal care services so that we can better
support seniors to age-in-place in community, even as their needs increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the HPC+ service, seniors can receive services to support their
care in the community, such as assistance with showering and housekeeping.
 It will also include a 24/7 technology-enabled monitoring and response
element to detect falls and incidents, and provide timely support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MOH will mainstream HPC+ island-wide by end-2025 to better support more
seniors. More information on the home personal care services can be found
on the <a href="https://www.aic.sg/care-services/home-personal-care/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>AIC website</u></a>.</p>

<p>The Shared Stay-in Senior Care Services is a care model where a caregiver
assists a group of seniors with their activities of daily living and social
programmes in a shared premises, similar to how families would provide
caregiving for their loved ones. Service providers enjoy work pass flexibilities
to support a sustainable model of manpower deployment to care for seniors
round-the-clock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>Service providers, families and seniors can refer to the guide on the
recommended good practices when providing or seeking such a service. More
information on the application details for interested service providers
and the good practice guide can be found on the <a href="https://www.aic.sg/partners/pilot-projects-and-programmes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>AIC website</u></a>from

<h4>Seamless delivery of care</h4>

<p>Today, seniors with multiple care needs may have to interact with multiple
care providers and undergo repeated assessments from each provider. For
example, they may need to interact with a day care centre, and a home care
provider.</p>
<p>To provide a more seamless care journey for seniors and their caregivers,
we will appoint an Integrated Community Care Provider (ICCP) to oversee
care coordination for each region. We have been in consultation with key
stakeholders and many of our sector partners are supportive of this effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will encourage existing providers to come together and form partnerships
to perform the ICCP functions, and are working towards implementing this
across Singapore by 2026.</p>

<p>Caregivers can tap on up to $400 in <a href="https://www.aic.sg/financial-assistance/caregivers-training-grant-ctg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Caregivers’ Training Grant (CTG)</u></a> subsidies
per year, double that of $200 today. We will also allow caregivers to tap
on their SkillsFuture Credit to pay for eligible caregiver courses, to
further reduce the cost of training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these, we will scale up the number of subsidised training places
for caregivers, to 4,400 each year across 200 courses.</p>
