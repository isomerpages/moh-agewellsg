<h4>Strengthening Support for Seniors with Care Needs</h4>

<p>Beyond supporting seniors to age actively, we also understand that there
are seniors who are concerned about being adequately cared for in their
homes and in their community.</p>
<p>To strengthen support for frailer seniors and provide greater reassurance
to family members, we are developing more options for seniors to receive
timely and appropriate care right where they are.</p>
<h4>Enhanced Home Personal Care (HPC+)&nbsp;</h4>
<p>We are enhancing the home personal care services so that we can better
support seniors to age-in-place in community, even as their needs increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the HPC+ service, seniors can receive services to support their
care in the community, such as assistance with showering and housekeeping.
 It will also include a 24/7 technology-enabled monitoring and response
element to detect falls and incidents, and provide timely support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MOH will progressively roll out HPC+ islandwide to better support more
seniors. More information on the home personal care services can be found
on the <a href="https://www.aic.sg/care-services/home-personal-care/" class="Hyperlink SCXW156099994 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>AIC website</u></a>.</p>
<h4>Stay-in Shared Caregiving Sandbox</h4>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2023, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), with
support from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), launched applications for
a sandbox to explore the viability of new stay-in shared caregiving models
for seniors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This will mitigate the impact on family caregiving that shrinking family
sizes have brought about and offer more options for seniors, especially
those living alone, to age in the community with care support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four companies have been onboarded onto the sandbox and will be receiving
foreign manpower concessions to overcome manpower challenges. More information
on the sandbox can be found the <a href="https://www.aic.sg/partners/pilot-projects-and-programmes/" class="Hyperlink SCXW5267923 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>AIC website</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Seamless delivery of care</h4>

<p>Today, seniors with multiple care needs may have to interact with multiple
care providers and undergo repeated assessments from each provider. For
example, they may need to interact with a day care centre, and also home
care provider.</p>
<p>We will help seniors and their caregivers have a more seamless care journey
by having a single point of contact to meet their multiple care needs from
various providers. The point of contact will perform the role of a single
bundled service provider, coordinating care across service providers for
the seniors.</p>
<p>It will use a standardised care assessment tool, to plan and address the
senior’s care needs. This reduces the need for multiple assessments and
unnecessary referrals by different care providers.</p>
<p>These efforts to improve coordination in the sector will take place progressively
from the second half of 2024, and in consultation with stakeholders.</p>
<h4>Support for Caregiver Training</h4>

<p>From 1 April 2024, caregivers can tap on up to $400 in <a href="https://www.aic.sg/financial-assistance/caregivers-training-grant-ctg/" class="Hyperlink SCXW151840351 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Caregivers’ Training Grant (CTG)</u></a> subsidies
per year, double that of $200 today. We will also allow caregivers to tap
on their SkillsFuture Credit to pay for eligible caregiver courses, to
further reduce the cost of training. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With these, we will scale up the number of subsidised training places
for caregivers, to 4,400 each year across 200 courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
