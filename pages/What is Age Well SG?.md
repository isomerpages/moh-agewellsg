<p><strong>Age Well SG is a national programme led by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of National Development and Ministry of Transport to support seniors to age well in their homes and their communities. It aims to support our seniors to age actively, stay socially connected, and be cared for within their communities.</strong>

<p><strong>The United Nations defines a country as ‘ageing’ if the share of its population aged 65 and above crosses 7%. It is considered ‘aged’ if the share exceeds 14%. Once the share reaches 21%, it is ‘super aged’.</strong>

<p>Singapore took only 19 years to go from 'ageing' to 'aged’, and reached
this milestone in 2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are projected to attain ‘super aged’ status in 2026.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By 2030, 1 in 4 citizens will be aged 65 and above.</p>

<p>Age Well SG offers a comprehensive nationwide transformation across the
areas of transport, housing, active ageing and care services to anchor
ageing in the community. The programme aims to:</p>
<p>a) Improve the physical living environment.</p>
<p>b) Encourage active ageing.</p>
<p>c) Strengthen support for seniors with care needs in the community.</p>
<p><strong>To support these changes, the Government will dedicate at least $3.5b over the next decade to support the implementation of Age Well SG.</strong>
