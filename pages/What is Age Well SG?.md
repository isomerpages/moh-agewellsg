**Age Well SG is a national programme led by MOH, MND and MOT to support seniors to age well in their homes and their communities. It aims to tackle social isolation, which is a key determinant of frailty, and empower seniors to age actively and independently.**

*“Together, we will make Singapore an endearing home for all ages, where seniors can age with dignity and grace, connected with friends and family, and enjoying greater peace of mind.”*

*- Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, National Day Rally, 20th August 2023*

**The United Nations defines a country as ‘ageing’ if the share of its population aged 65 and above crosses 7%. It is considered ‘aged’ if the share exceeds 14%. Once the share reaches 21%, it is ‘super aged’.**
* Singapore took only 19 years to go from 'ageing' to 'aged’, and reached this milestone in 2017. 
* We are projected to attain ‘super aged’ status in 2026. 
* By 2030, 1 in 4 citizens will be aged 65 and above.
