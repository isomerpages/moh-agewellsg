![](/images/what%20is%20age%20well.jpg)

Age Well SG is a national programme led by MOH, MND and MOT to support seniors to age in their homes and their communities. It aims to tackle social isolation, which is a key determinant of frailty, and empower seniors to age actively and independently.

***“Together, we will make Singapore an endearing home for all ages, where seniors can age with dignity and grace, connected with friends and family, and enjoying greater peace of mind.” - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, National Day Rally, 20th August 2023***

## Singapore is one of the fastest-ageing countries in the world ##

*The United Nations defines a country as ‘ageing’ if the share of its population aged 65 and above crosses 7%. It is considered ‘aged’ if the share exceeds 14%. Once the share reaches 21%, it is ‘super aged’.*

* Singapore took only 19 years and became ‘aged’ in 2017. 
* We are projected to attain ‘super aged’ status in 2026. 
* By 2030, 1 in 4 citizens will be aged 65 and above.
