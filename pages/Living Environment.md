**To support seniors to age safely and confidently in familiar environments, we are enhancing  our HDB homes and precincts to make them more senior-friendly**

* Within flats, we will expand the scope of the existing Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme under “EASE 2.0” to offer a greater variety of improvements, such as foldable shower seats and widened toilet entrances for wheelchair users.

* We will upgrade our housing estates to include senior-friendly features, such as therapeutic gardens and fitness trails, barrier-free access ramps and rest points along linkways, and dementia-friendly features to improve wayfinding. We will start with towns with more seniors such as Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah.

* To complement these efforts, we will expand the Friendly Streets initiative to create safer and more inclusive commutes, and encourage more active lifestyles
* Friendly Streets will include more pedestrian crossings, wider and more accessible footpaths, traffic calming measures, and more frequent and longer Green Man activations

* We will also offer more senior-centric housing options for seniors to age independently in the community, by building more Community Care Apartments (CCAs) and releasing land for development of private assisted living facilities
