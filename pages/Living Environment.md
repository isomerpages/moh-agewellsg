**To support seniors to age safely and confidently in familiar environments, we are enhancing  our HDB homes and precincts to make them more senior-friendly.**

##### EASE 2.0 #####

Within flats, we will expand the scope of the existing Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme under “EASE 2.0” to offer a greater variety of improvements, such as foldable shower seats and widened toilet entrances for wheelchair users.

##### Senior-friendly neighbourhoods #####

We will upgrade our housing estates to include senior-friendly features, such as therapeutic gardens and fitness trails, barrier-free access ramps and rest points along linkways, and dementia-friendly features to improve wayfinding. We will start with towns with more seniors such as Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah.

##### Senior-friendly streets #####

With our Friendly Streets initiative, we are also doing more to help seniors and the wider community commute more safely around their neighbourhoods, and encourage more active lifestyles. 

Friendly Streets will include more pedestrian crossings, wider and more accessible footpaths, traffic calming measures, and more frequent and longer Green Man activations

##### Community Care Apartments (CCAs) #####

We will also offer more senior-centric housing options for seniors to age independently in the community, by building more CCAs and releasing land for development of private assisted living facilities
