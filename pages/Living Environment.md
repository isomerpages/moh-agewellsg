<p><strong>To promote active ageing and help seniors move about more safely and comfortably, we will enhance the physical living environment in both HDB precincts and private residential estates. This initiative aims to make it easier and safer for seniors to engage in their daily activities.</strong>
</p>
<h5>Within HDB flats</h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>We are offering a wider range of senior-friendly fittings under the Enhancement
for Active Seniors (EASE) programme. These include bidet sprays, foldable
U-profile grab bars and lowered toilet entrance kerbs.</p>
<p>Eligible flat owners can apply or opt for the new improvement items together
with the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) or through the e-Service on HDB
InfoWeb.</p>

<p>To better support low-income and vulnerable seniors who may lack family
support, we will extend the wireless Alert Alarm System (AAS) to all seniors
aged 60 and above living in about 170 public rental blocks. This will benefit
around 26, 800 more seniors.</p>
<p>The roll-out will commence from January 2025, and will cover three rental
blocks per month, starting with those that have a higher number of seniors,
such as in Bukit Merah and Kallang-Whampoa.</p>
<h5>Within private residential properties</h5>
<p>To support ageing-in-place, we also want to do more to allow our seniors
living in private residential properties to engage in their daily activities
safely and comfortably. Hence, MND will expand the EASE programme &nbsp;to
private residential properties.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Citizen households living in private properties,
with at least one senior, ill be eligible to engage a contractor, to supply
and install senior-friendly fittings that will be made available under
the EASE (Private).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EASE (Private) will
be rolled out as a three-year programme, and it is targeted to be launched
by the first quarter of 2026. More details can be found on <a href="https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-matters/speeches/view/speech-by-minister-desmond-lee-at-the-committee-of-supply-debate" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MND’s website</a>.</p>

<h5>At the HDB precincts and private residential estates</h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>We will extend the fifth phase of the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme
(NRP) to older HDB estates comprising blocks built up to 1999. This will
benefit over 100,000 more flats. Under this new phase, we will also build
more senior-friendly amenities that will better support seniors to age
in place.</p>
<p>For older precincts that already underwent upgrading and are no longer
eligible for further upgrading under the NRP, we will roll out similar
senior-friendly enhancements to over 20 of such precincts in Ang Mo Kio,
Bukit Merah, Queenstown and Toa Payoh over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>Possible enhancements include therapeutic gardens, fitness trails, barrier-free
access ramps and rest points, and dementia-friendly features to improve
way-finding. These upgrading initiatives will complement Healthier SG to
support seniors in leading an active lifestyle and will be gradually implemented
over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>Similar upgrading works will be carried out at selected older private
residential estates, under the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP). Additionally,
we will identify and select estates with a higher concentration of seniors,
including those that have benefited from EUP some time ago, for senior-friendly
enhancements.</p>

<p>To provide more assisted living options for seniors to age in place, we
will ramp up the supply of Community Care Apartments (CCAs). Seniors living
in CCAs can enjoy convenient access to various amenities.</p>
<h5>Friendly Streets</h5>

<p><em>The green road markings serve to remind motorists that they are entering a “Friendly Street” and they should lower their speed and look out for pedestrians</em>

<p><em>Raised zebra crossings act as a hump to slow down vehicles. The added elevation also makes crossing pedestrians more visible to motorists</em>
</p>
<p>With our Friendly Streets initiative, we are doing more to further enhance
safety and convenience for residents, especially seniors, to move around
their neighbourhoods, and encourage more active lifestyles.</p>
<p>Launched in 2023, the initiative aims to make the walking and cycling
experience to markets, hawker centres and MRT stations in neighbourhoods
even more comfortable, convenient and safe. All five pilot sites – Ang
Mo Kio, Bukit Batok West, Tampines, Toa Payoh and West Coast - are near
key amenities and see high pedestrian flows.</p>
<p>There will be features like longer and more frequent green man signs,
raised zebra crossings and barrier-free pedestrian crossings such as kerbless
crossings, so our seniors and families with young children have more time
to cross the road. It will also include traffic calming measures such as
road humps to slow vehicles down.</p>

<p><em>Street signs, green road surface markings and kerbless crossings</em>
</p>
<p>Each pilot is spearheaded by a taskforce, comprising grassroots leaders
and representatives from relevant government agencies. LTA had worked closely
with the respective taskforces on the features and traffic measures to
be implemented in each pilot site. We had also engaged residents and community
stakeholders to seek feedback on the plans for each location.</p>
<p>Building on the community’s positive feedback from our five pilot sites,
we are expanding the Friendly Streets initiative to all HDB towns by 2030,
as well as to private estates with high-activity areas and key amenities
nearby.</p>
<p>We are working towards introducing Friendly Streets at 10 new locations
-- Bedok, Buangkok, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East, Pek Kio,
Punggol, Holland/Buona Vista, Sembawang and Tiong Bahru/Havelock. These
locations have a higher proportion of seniors or young families who will
especially benefit from the convenience and having safer roads. We will
take into account learning points from the pilot locations, and continue
to work closely with the local communities as we implement Friendly Streets
in more towns.</p>
<h5>Enhanced Commuter Infrastructure</h5>
<p>In support of Age Well SG, we will enhance our commuter infrastructure,
to make walking to key public transport nodes more convenient, comfortable
and accessible, especially for seniors. Residents will benefit from more
covered linkways, upgraded bus stops with senior-friendly features, and
more pedestrian overhead bridges with lifts. Besides helping seniors stay
socially connected and active, these will create more comfortable and safer
commutes for all.</p>
<p><strong>More bus stops with senior-friendly features</strong>
