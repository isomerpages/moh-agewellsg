#### Strengthening Support for Seniors with Care Needs

Beyond supporting seniors to age actively, we also understand that there are seniors who are concerned about being adequately cared for in their homes and in their community. 

 To strengthen support for frailer seniors and provide greater reassurance to family members, we are developing more options for seniors to receive timend appropriate care right where they are. 

#### Stay-in Shared Caregiving Sandbox

In September 2023, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), with support from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), launched applications for a sandbox to explore the viability of new stay-in shared caregiving models for seniors.  

We hope to support private sector innovation to widen the range of care solutions for seniors to age in the community. 

Participating companies will be supported through foreign manpower concessions to mitigate manpower challenges.  

 
As of end-October 2023, 5 companies have onboarded the sandbox and aim to serve an estimated 800 senior clients. 

####  Seamless delivery of care

Today, aged care delivery is fragmented, with multiple services and providers in most regions. Seniors with multiple care needs will have to coordinate with various providers and undergo multiple non-standardised assessments.   

To relieve seniors and their caregivers the frustrations of a fragmented landscape and help them enjoy a more seamless and coordinated care journey, we will restructure the aged care landscape. 


Under this new model, a single bundled-services provider (BP) will act as the single point of contact for seniors, and offer key care services (Active Ageing Centres, Senior Care Centres, Enhanced Home Personal Care, and Community Rehabilitation) to seniors based on a single care plan developed using a single care assessment tool. The BP may deliver these services directly or coordinate with other providers within the sub-region to deliver these services to seniors.

Under the bundled services model, the BP takes ownership and has end-to-end visibility of the senior’s entire care journey. Seniors can be connected to the care services they need the most, without additional referrals and reassessments by different parties. 

These efforts to restructure the sector will take place progressively from 2024.  

#### Support for Caregiver Training

To make it easier for every Singaporean family to have a trained caregiver, we will increase the Caregivers’ Training Grant (CTG) from the existing $200 per year, to up to $400.  

From April 2024, eligible beneficiaries will start off with a $400 grant. Each year, we will top up beneficiaries’ CTG accounts by $200, and allow unused monies to be carried forward, with the grant monies in each account capped at $400.  

Caregivers will also be able to tap on SkillsFuture Subsidies and use their SkillsFuture Credits for selected caregiving courses from November 2023, further reducing the cost of training. 


AIC and SkillsFuture Singapore will scale up the number of places if needed to ensure that there are sufficient training places to meet the needs of caregivers.
