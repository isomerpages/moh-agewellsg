#### Ageing actively in the community ####

**In tandem with [Healthier SG](https://www.healthiersg.gov.sg) which looks at preventive care for all Singaporeans, we need a tailored approach targeted at supporting seniors to age actively and healthily.**

#### The enhancement of the Active Ageing Centres (AACs) is one of our key strategies. ####

We will strengthen the programmes offered by AACs through standardised evidence-informed initiatives under key domains (e.g. social, physical, cognitive) to improve seniors’ self-management of health.

AACs will encourage seniors to be engaged through activities, such as communal meals, as a starting point to foster social interactions and reduce social isolation.

The Silver Generation Office (SGO) will also prioritise outreach to seniors at greater risk of social isolation and frailty and encourage them to join their neighbourhood AACs.

#### Can I attend an AAC? ####

Yes! The AACs are suitable for all seniors who would like to remain physically, mentally and socially active. They offer a range of activities and programmes for seniors with varied interests and abilities. 

 **Interested to participate in an AAC?**
 
You may locate the AAC nearest you [here](www.go.gov.sg/aacgowhere).  

**Are activities and programmes offered by the AACs free of charge?**

Most activities offered by the AACs are free for seniors to enjoy. However, depending on the service provider, there may be some unique activities that require a small fee for participation.

#### Keen to share a skill, or support fellow seniors? ####

AACs will also offer more opportunities for seniors to volunteer, keeping them active, purposeful and involved in their community.

Sign up as a [Silver Generation Volunteer](https://for.sg/aac-volunteer-application) today! 

We will also scale up the number of AACs from 154 today so that nearly all seniors will have an AAC near their homes

To further improve accessibility, we will leverage community spaces beyond the AAC premises, such as co-using Residents’ Networks (RN).
