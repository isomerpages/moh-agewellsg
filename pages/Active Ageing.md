<p><strong>In tandem with <a href="https://www.healthiersg.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Healthier SG</a>, which looks at preventive care for all Singaporeans, we need a tailored approach targeted at supporting seniors to age actively and healthily.</strong>
</p>
<h4>The enhancement of the Active Ageing Centres (AACs) is one of our key strategies.</h4>

<p>With 223 AACs island wide, 8 in 10 seniors now have access to a centre
near their home. We will continue to expand the AAC network to reach more
seniors in the community.</p>
<p>To further improve accessibility, AACs provide their programmes beyond
the confines of their centres, including at Residents’ Networks, sports
centres and void decks.</p>
<p>AACs also offer a wide range of programmes across five key domains of
social, physical health, cognitive, learning and volunteerism.</p>
<p>These include befriending services, group physical activities and other
active ageing programmes, and social support for vulnerable seniors. These
evidence-informed programmes cater to all seniors, with different programmes
designed for different needs.</p>
<p>AACs will encourage seniors to be engaged through activities, such as
communal meals, as a starting point to foster social interactions and reduce
social isolation.</p>
<p>The Silver Generation Office (SGO) will also prioritise outreach to seniors
at greater risk of social isolation and frailty and encourage them to join
their neighbourhood AACs.</p>
<h4>Can I attend an AAC?</h4>

<p>Yes! The AACs are suitable for all seniors who would like to remain physically,
mentally and socially active. They offer a range of activities and programmes
for seniors with varied interests and abilities.</p>
