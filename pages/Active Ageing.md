**In tandem with Healthier SG which looks at preventive care for all Singaporeans, we need a tailored approach targeted at supporting seniors to age actively and healthily.**

**The enhancement of the Active Ageing Centres (AACs) is one of our key strategies.**

* We will strengthen the programmes offered by AACs through standardised evidence-informed initiatives under key domains (e.g. social, physical, cognitive) to improve seniors’ self-management of health  

* AACs will encourage seniors to be engaged through activities, such as communal meals, as a starting point to foster social interactions and reduce social isolation
	* The Silver Generation Office (SGO) will also prioritise outreach to seniors at greater risk of social isolation and frailty and encourage them to join their neighbourhood AACs 

* AACs will also offer more opportunities for seniors to volunteer, keeping them active, purposeful and involved in their community 

* We will also scale up the number of AACs from 154 today so that nearly all seniors will have an AAC near their homes
	* To further improve accessibility, we will leverage community spaces beyond the AAC premises, such as co-using Residents’ Networks (RN).
