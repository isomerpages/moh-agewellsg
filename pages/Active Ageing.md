**In tandem with Healthier SG which looks at preventive care for all Singaporeans, we need a tailored approach targeted at supporting seniors to age actively and healthily.**

### The enhancement of the Active Ageing Centres (AACs) is one of our key strategies.

We will strengthen the programmes offered by AACs through standardised evidence-informed initiatives under key domains (e.g. social, physical, cognitive) to improve seniors’ self-management of health.

AACs will encourage seniors to be engaged through activities, such as communal meals, as a starting point to foster social interactions and reduce social isolation.

The Silver Generation Office (SGO) will also prioritise outreach to seniors at greater risk of social isolation and frailty and encourage them to join their neighbourhood AACs.

    <div>
      <p>Healthier SG is a national initiative to transform Singapore’s healthcare system to have a greater focus on preventive care to help residents stay healthy, detect health issues early and manage them well. Under Healthier SG, residents will be empowered to take steps to improve their health proactively with the support of their trusted family clinic and community partners.</p>

<p>Healthier SG empowers you to take charge of your health and supports you every step of the way.

    <div>
			<p>	Singapore Ccitizens (SC) and Ppermanent Rresidents (PR) can enrol into Healthier SG.</p>
      <p>From May 2023, residents aged 40 years and above with chronic illness and who are already seeing a Healthier SG-registered GP for the care of their chronic condition can pre-enrol. The Healthier SG GP clinic will be engaging you if you fall under this category.</p>

<p>From July 2023, MOH will progressively invite Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 60 years and above via SMS to enrol to in a Healthier SG clinic or polyclinic. SMS invitations will also be sent progressively to those aged 40 to 59 years.</p>

<p>The rollout phases will prioritise those who are more likely to need medical care or suffer from chronic illnesses.</p>

We will also scale up the number of AACs from 154 today so that nearly all seniors will have an AAC near their homes

To further improve accessibility, we will leverage community spaces beyond the AAC premises, such as co-using Residents’ Networks (RN).
